12/19/2025 v1.3.0
- Added support for 'destructive' tag for the Severe Thunderstorm Warning. These are issued by the NWS for specific hazardous conditions which trigger WEA activation.
- Moved locations and messages to separate files. This sets the groundwork for adding locations in the future.
- ALL alerts now use embedded text boxes for the alert body. More info in a better, prettier layout.
- Refactored some of the message code for better reusability.
