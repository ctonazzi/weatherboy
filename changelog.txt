8/19/2025 v1.2.2
- Added new tag to all alerts that displays whether it is a new alert or an update to an older alert. This should clear up some confusion about repeat extreme heat warnings.
- Added more alerts.
- Added Discord rich presence activity to bot, currently just shows active alert count.
- Added !alerts command.
- Backend overhaul of how alerts are cached and processed. This will help with adding more features in the future.
- Added support for special weather statements. These will display the full description in an embedded message.
- bugfix: found and repaired an issue with empty messages crashing bot.
- bugfix: bot loss of connection would result in online message being sent again. This was unintended behavior and should be fixed now.
- bugfix: using !alerts with no active alerts will now tell you that there are no active alerts.
- bugfix: alerts status should now accurately reflect the number of alerts in the cache.
