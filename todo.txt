TODO: add commands to add/remove locations
- This will likely require a library to parse locations to coordinates (lat,long)
- Exception handling for empty string, location out of range (not in the US). --- MAY REQUIRE MACHINE LEARNING
- May require refactoring of the API call function to prevent rate limiting in the event a goober adds 500 locations.
TODO: refactor main bot script, consider moving API call section to own script.
- Move message formatting to its own class
